* ~d12-hs-env~

Environment helpers that are used in personal projects.

Currently there is only one module =Env= that exposes two functions: ~env~ and
~envMaybe~.

  λ> :t getEnv
  getEnv :: (MonadThrow m, MonadIO m) => Text -> m Text
  λ> :t envMaybe
  envMaybe :: MonadIO m => Text -> m (Maybe Text)
  λ> :t envRead
  envRead :: MonadIO m => Reader a -> Text -> m (Maybe a)
  λ> env "XDG_CONFIG_HOME"
  "/Users/d12frosted/.environment"
  λ> env "FALSE"
  *** Exception: Could not find value of $FALSE in environment.
